  Gatsby Source Holiday Extras

** This Plugin is Still in Alpha release and is subject to breaking changes until V1 is offificially releases **

## What does this plugin do?

This plugin queries Information from Holiday Extras Product Library.
Details of the API can be found by visiting the [Holiday Extras API Docs](https://docs.holidayextras.co.uk/hxapi/productlibrary/)

## Why should you use it?

This Service is great for generating information about products and services Holiday Extras provides. You can use this data to generate your own informational pages using Gatsby. We recommend using this service with your own content for SEO.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

```shell
npm install gatsby-source-holidayextras
```

## Add environment variables

Environment variables allow you to safely store sensitive information about your projects, like your API Key or Access Tokem. At the root of your project, create two files:

.env.development
.env.production

Then, add the variables on each file to match your HX API information.
HX_API_KEY
HX_API_TOKEN

## Configure the plugin

Define the plugin configuration in the `gatsby-config.js` file. The following gives a basic example of the plugin.

```shell
require('dotenv').config({
  path: `.env.${process.env.NODE_ENV}`,
})

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: gatsby-source-holidayextras,
      options: {
        hotels: [array of HX hotel codes],
        lounges: [array of HX lounge codes],
        parking: [array of HX car park codes],
        key: process.env.HX_API_KEY,
        token: process.env.HX_API_TOKEN
      }
    },
  ]
}
```

Running this in your project will return the recommended and optional keys listed on the
[Holiday Extras API Docs](https://docs.holidayextras.co.uk/hxapi/productlibrary/) for Parking, Hotels and Lounges with a few exceptions.

Images are returned as an array of images
Anything lists on the API docs as 'tripappXYZ' is now just XYZ for simplicity

Extra fields include:

```
airport
productCode
productType
```
